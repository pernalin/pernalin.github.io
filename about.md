I'm a software developer who for the last 15 years has lead global technology teams in developing large scale high 
performance commercial (off-the-shelf) software as well as internet facing enterprise applications.

Currently, my interests include development using the .NET ecosystem, mobile development (iOS/Objective-C) and 
researching LAMP/MAMP based frameworks and tools that enable rapid software development.

I'm a Sri Lankan who lives in Connecticut, USA.
