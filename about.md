I'm a software developer at heart who for the last 15 years has lead global technology teams in developing solutions that drive business strategies and objectives.

Currently, my interests include development using the .NET ecosystem, mobile development (iOS/Objective-C) and researching LAMP/MAMP based frameworks and tools that enable Rapid Software Development.

I live in Connecticut, USA.
